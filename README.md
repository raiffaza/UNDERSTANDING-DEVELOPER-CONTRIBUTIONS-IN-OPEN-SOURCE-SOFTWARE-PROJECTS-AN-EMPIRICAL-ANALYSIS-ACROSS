# Understanding Developer Contributions in Open-Source Software Projects: An Empirical Analysis Across NuGet, PyPI, and NPM Repositories

This empirical study investigates collaborative dynamics within open-source software (OSS) projects, focusing on contributions in **NuGet**, **PyPI**, and **NPM** repositories hosted on GitHub. The goal is to deepen our understanding of developer participation in OSS projects, thereby enhancing their development and long-term sustainability.

## Key Research Inquiries:

1. **Distribution of Contributions**: Analyzing contributions across categories like **code**, **documentation**, and **issue management**.
2. **Evolution of Contributions Over Time**: Examining how developer contributions change over time within NuGet, PyPI, and NPM repositories.

The study aims to provide project maintainers with insights into developer roles, enabling the design of tailored strategies for engagement, recognition, and motivation. For example, ecosystems emphasizing code contributions may benefit from structured code review processes, while those focusing on documentation may prioritize acknowledging and incentivizing technical writers.

## Methodology:

* **Content Analysis**: Classifying contributions based on commit messages, pull requests, and issue interactions.
* **Time-Series Analysis**: Depicting trends in contributions over time to identify patterns and potential challenges.

## Outcomes:

This study provides actionable recommendations for nurturing OSS communities, advocating best practices, and improving collaborative dynamics critical for advancing these ecosystems.
